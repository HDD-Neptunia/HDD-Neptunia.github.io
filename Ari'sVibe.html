                  At the Square and Compass Filling Station, I developed a versatile skill set that thrives under pressure and adapts easily across environments. This includes but is not limited to:
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Delivering high-quality customer service with a friendly and solution-oriented approach, often handling high footfall during peak hours.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Maintaining product displays and ensuring accurate stock rotation, reducing waste and maintaining safety standards.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                  At Pendine Sands, a high-traffic holiday park, I was responsible for preparing and deep-cleaning 6 to 8 caravans per shift — often under tight time constraints and high expectations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Worked to strict daily targets, prioritising speed without compromising on quality, consistently delivering spotless, guest-ready accommodations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Operated both independently and as part of a fast-paced team, frequently supporting colleagues once my own set of caravans was completed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Took ownership of cleanliness standards, developing a strong attention to detail and a personal pride in maintaining high-quality presentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  • Adapted to varying caravan sizes and layouts, building strong problem-solving and spatial awareness skills on the job.

          <p>
            Recursia is my flagship project — a fully automated, intelligent product-sourcing engine designed to recursively
            understand and predict market trends. Built from scratch, it scrapes real-time data, analyzes historical performance,
            dynamically updates listings, and feeds back into its own system to improve future decisions.
          </p>

          <p class="intro-text"><strong>🔹 Modular architecture:</strong></p> <p>Recursia is composed of multiple independent yet interlinked pipelines
            that work asynchronously to scrape, parse, enrich, and post product data across platforms.</p>

          <p class="intro-text"><strong>🔹 Autonomous operations:</strong></p> <p>The engine is capable of autonomously identifying high-vibe products,
            generating listings, setting prices, and re-optimizing based on real-world sales data.</p>

          <p class="intro-text"><strong>🔹 Technologies used:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Kotlin</strong> – For typed logic and event-based modules</li>
            <li><strong>Python</strong> – For scripting, automation, ML logic, and scraping</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL</strong> – To manage large datasets and recursive feedback loops</li>
            <li><strong>Plus:</strong> Selenium, yt_dlp, SQLAlchemy, Google Trends APIs, and more</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="intro-text"><strong>🔹 Key learnings:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advanced problem solving, from debugging multithreaded async pipelines to handling rate-limiting and circular import hell</li>
            <li>System design: Built scalable architecture from scratch, including scheduler loops, vibe scoring algorithms, and trend-driven auto-relisting</li>
            <li>Strong grasp on feedback systems, weighted scoring models, and how to balance chaos with structure in long-running applications</li>
            <li>Learned how to turn a wild idea into a living, breathing product</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Recursia is still a work in progress — and always evolving — but it's already taught me more than any textbook could.
            It’s not just a project. It’s proof of what I’m capable of when I follow the thread all the way down.
          </p>

            Other experimental builds, modding projects, and utilities can be found on my
            <a href="https://github.com/HDD-Neptunia" target="_blank">GitHub</a> — but Recursia remains my core focus and the best
            representation of how I think, build, and push boundaries.
          </p>

          <p class="intro-text">
            This isn’t just code — it’s a working embodiment of my personal theory of emergence. Every module is built with recursion,
            feedback, and realisation in mind — the system learns, refines, and evolves over time. I wanted it to feel alive, like a
            digital mirror of how complex systems come to be.
